# Project-2-api-client / My Travelgram

This project is a a great combination of my passions, coding and traveling and I called it "My Travelgram". After sign-in, you can create your flight with the place you have visited, date when you visited the place and a short description of the place. You can also update the flight ,delete the flight by user id and you can get the flight you ant or you can get all the flights.

I really enjoyed every step of this project. The first step of the project was building how the MVP should be ,following by my user stories, wireframe and ERD.
